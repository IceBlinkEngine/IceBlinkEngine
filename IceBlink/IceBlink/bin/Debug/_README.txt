Release Notes:
v1.00 - Initial release
v1.01 - added mouse/touch left click movement on adjacent squares for all eight directions in combat.
      - added color coding of items in party inventory to show useable (black) and non-useable (red) items for the currently selected PC.
      - can now scale the adventure map log text. the toggle (on/off) hotkey "s" brings up or hides the font scale buttons. A+ to increase, A- to decrease.
      - added or edited the following scripts: gaSetGlobalInt.cs (now includes "++" and "--" options), itBless.cs, itHaste.cs, itHealModerate.cs and pcOnScoringHit_SleepOne.cs
      - allow multiple response lines for narration dialogs (self adjusting window)
      - added a few more convo tokens (lad/lass, race (already had Race), class (already had Class), man/woman, Man/Woman, etc.)
      - Added the ability to use [b][/b] and [i][/i] type tags in conversations. Only works on NPC nodes, NOT on PC nodes (NPC nodes are in a RichTexBox control that allows varying font styles on the same string, PC nodes are LinkLabel controls that only allow one font style per control...winform issue that we hope to move away from winforms someday).
